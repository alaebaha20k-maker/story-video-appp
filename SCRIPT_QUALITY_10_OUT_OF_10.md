lightbulb swaying, shadows moving on cracked concrete walls, horror 
atmosphere, wide shot, eerie lighting, suspenseful mood.

I stand frozen at the top step. The voice calls again. "Come down, 
son." It sounds exactly like him. The same rasp. The same warmth.
But I buried him myself.

My hand grips the railing. The wood is ice cold...
```

**Quality:** 10/10 for horror! ✅

Her smile hits me like lightning. I've seen her every day for six 
months at this coffee shop, and today I finally said hello.

steam rising from coffee cup, intimate medium close-up, romantic
