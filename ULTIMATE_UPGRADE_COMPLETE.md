### **2. ⏱️ PERFECT VOICE/VIDEO TIMING**

**Fixed:**
```
PROBLEM: Voice stops before video ends
SOLUTION: Perfect duration calculation!
```

**How it works:**
```python
# Step 1: Calculate exact words needed
words_needed = duration_minutes * 150

# Step 2: Generate script with EXACT word count
script = claude.generate(words_needed)

# Step 3: Generate voice from script
voice_audio = puter_tts.generate(script)
voice_duration = get_duration(voice_audio)  # e.g., 10.5 minutes

# Step 4: Calculate image duration
image_duration = voice_duration / num_images  # e.g., 63 seconds per image

# Step 5: Compile with FFmpeg
ffmpeg -loop 1 -t {image_duration} -i image1.jpg \
       -loop 1 -t {image_duration} -i image2.jpg \
       ... (all images) ...
       -i voice.mp3 \
       -shortest  # Ends when voice ends!
```

**Result:**
- ✅ 10-min video = 10-min voice = 10-min images
- ✅ 60-min video = 60-min voice = 60-min images
- ✅ NO silent ending!
- ✅ PERFECT synchronization!

---

### **3. 🎨 ALL IMAGES UNIQUE & STORY-MATCHED**

**Fixed:**
```
PROBLEM: Images might repeat or not match story
SOLUTION: Extract unique IMAGE from script!
```

**How it works:**
1. ✅ Claude generates script with {num_scenes} IMAGE: tags
2. ✅ Each IMAGE description is UNIQUE and SPECIFIC
3. ✅ Descriptions match story progression:
   - Scene 1: Opening/establishing
   - Scene 2: Character introduction
   - Scene 3-8: Rising action
   - Scene 9: Climax
   - Scene 10: Resolution
4. ✅ FLUX.1 Schnell generates each image uniquely
5. ✅ NO repeated images!

**Example progression (10-scene horror story):**
```
IMAGE 1: Wide shot of old Victorian house at dusk, ominous clouds...
IMAGE 2: Close-up of trembling hand on brass doorknob, shadows...
IMAGE 3: Dark hallway stretching ahead, flickering lights...
IMAGE 4: Face reflected in dusty mirror, fear in eyes...
IMAGE 5: Basement stairs descending into darkness...
IMAGE 6: Old photograph on wall showing same house, 1920s...
IMAGE 7: Attic door slowly opening, eerie light spilling out...
IMAGE 8: Close-up of ancient diary, bloodstained pages...
IMAGE 9: Dramatic shot of confrontation, supernatural presence...
IMAGE 10: Dawn breaking through windows, peaceful resolution...
```
